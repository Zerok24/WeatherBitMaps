WeatherBits is one of several fictitious companies 
created by Prof. David Bernstein, now a member of 
the Computer Science Department at James Madison University.

WeatherBits is currently developing a product named WeatherBitmaps.  
WeatherBitmaps is a multimedia information system that allows users 
to get information about current and forecasted weather conditions.

WeatherBits is planning to develop several other products, including: 
WeatherCell, a system for delivering localized weather information 
to cellular telephones and handheld computers; WeatherFend, a system 
that uses localized weather information to predict likely accident sites; 
WeatherOrKnot, a system for using localized weather information on boats 
and ships; and WeatherThouGoest, a system for incorporating localized 
weather information in in-vehicle navigation systems.
